# 🚀 AI Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of AI projects!
This repository is a curated showcase of various applications I've built using cutting-edge technologies in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI.

Each project highlights different frameworks, tools, and real-world use cases — from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and AI-powered chatbots to data-driven applications and automation systems.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

Large Language Models (LLMs) — Gemma, Ollama, OpenAI
Frameworks — LangChain, Gradio, Hugging Face
Development — Python, Jupyter Notebooks, APIs
Visualization — Gradio UI, Streamlit, Matplotlib
Deployment — Local hosting, Cloud deployment (Coming soon)

### 📚 Projects Included
